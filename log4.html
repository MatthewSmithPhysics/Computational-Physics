    <h2> Entry 4 - 1st February 2019 </h2>
    <h3> Hermitian Matrix Diagonalisation and Solving Simple Quantum Systems </h3>
	<p>
	For this entry, I accomplished two main things: I studied and coded methods to diagonalise matrices; I applied these methods to simple problems in quantum mechanics. The meat of this shall be discussed in the iPython notebooks that are linked. I have decided to start using these notebooks for a clearer correspondence between the theory and the code.

	<hr>
	<p>
	In doing this, I have learned: <br>
	- The Householder-QR Method of diagonalising Hermitian matrices <br>
	- The method of diagonalising tridiagonal matrices by properties Sturm sequences <br>
	- The convergence properties of the Householder method <br>
	- How to apply the Householder method to generalised eigenvalue problems <br>
	- A basic application of the above
	</p>
	
	<p>
	I intend to expand upon what I have done here, by studying non-analytic systems. Until then, I may publish my study of Monte Carlo methods.

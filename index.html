    <h2> What is This Page? </h2>
    This page documents my journey to self-learn computational physics. It is to serve as evidence to any employer or institution 
    that I have experience in computing in the context of physics and maths. Although knowledge in this field is no doubt helpful
    in my studies, my programme does not directly support and assess this, so I feel that this page's existence is necessary.

    <h2> What Resources am I Using? </h2>
	<p>
    I own a copy of <i>Computational Physics</i> by Thijssen. This is a fairly advanced textbook, which assumes a fair amount of undergraduate physics knowledge which I simply don't possess. I am thus keeping that one on standby until I have learned about the topics covered in that book. 
	</p>
	<p>
	For the first few entries in my log, I have been using K.F. Riley's <i>Mathematical Methods for the Physical Sciences</i> as a guide for what to study. I have mainly been writing the code for various numerical methods and also doing things like convergence tests to understand them. 
	</p>
	<p>
		As of January 2019, I own a copy of Sastry's <i> Introductory Methods of Numerical Analysis </i>. This should be helpful in studying specific techniques, particular those in linear algebra and ODEs/PDEs. 
	  </p>
	 
	<p>
	D	For technical subject knowledge, I have been using textbooks from my formal courses.

    <h2> What Experience do I Have Going In? </h2>
    As of writing (<i>26/06/2018</i>), I have just completed my first year of a Maths and Physics degree at Durham University. I
    have taken the courses Analysis I, Calculus and Probability I, Linear Algebra I, Foundations of Physics 1, and Discovery Skills
    in Physics  (lab work). I have been programming since 2013 and am fairly confident in using Java, Python, C++, and Fortran. In 
    terms of using this for physics and maths, I have created various simulations of physical systems for presentations to a 
    student-run Physics Society in sixth-form and am working on my own linear algebra C++ library, which is hosted on another 
    account's repository (I may port it onto this one).

    <h2> How Can You Follow My Work? </h2>
    I am going to be making a log of what I've been learning to this site and will leave links to each entry below. I will also
    make available the programs I write whilst studying. These can be found at <a href = "https://github.com/MatthewSmithPhysics/Computational-Physics">
    Computational Physics Respository </a>.

    <h2> What is This Page? </h2>
    This page documents my journey to self-learn computational physics. It is to serve as evidence to any employer or institution 
    that I have experience in computing in the context of physics and maths. Although knowledge in this field is no doubt helpful
    in my studies, my programme does not directly support and assess this, so I feel that this page's existence is necessary.

    <h2> What Resources am I Using </h2>
    I have not yet purchased a textbook but I have seen that <i> Computational Physics </i> by Thijssen is said to be quite good.

    <h2> What Experience do I Have Going In? </h2>
    As of writing (<i>26/06/2018</i>), I have just completed my first year of a Maths and Physics degree at Durham University. I
    have taken courses in Analysis, Calculus and Probability, Linear Algebra, Foundations of Physics, and Discovery Skills in 
    Physics  (lab work). I have been programming since 2013 and am fairly confident in using Java, Python, C++, and Fortran. In 
    terms of using this for physics and maths, I have created various simulations of physical systems for presentations to a 
    student-run Physics Society in sixth-form.

    <h2> What is This Page? </h2>
    This page documents my journey to self-learn computational physics. It is to serve as evidence to any employer or institution 
    that I have experience in computing in the context of physics and maths. Although knowledge in this field is no doubt helpful
    in my studies, my programme does not directly support and assess this, so I feel that this page's existence is necessary.

    <h2> What Resources am I Using? </h2>
    I have not yet purchased a textbook but I have seen that <i> Computational Physics </i> by Thijssen is said to be quite good.

    <h2> What Experience do I Have Going In? </h2>
    As of writing (<i>26/06/2018</i>), I have just completed my first year of a Maths and Physics degree at Durham University. I
    have taken the courses Analysis I, Calculus and Probability I, Linear Algebra I, Foundations of Physics 1, and Discovery Skills
    in Physics  (lab work). I have been programming since 2013 and am fairly confident in using Java, Python, C++, and Fortran. In 
    terms of using this for physics and maths, I have created various simulations of physical systems for presentations to a 
    student-run Physics Society in sixth-form and am working on my own linear algebra C++ library, which is hosted on another 
    account's repository (I may port it onto this one).

    <h2> How Can You Follow My Work? </h2>
    I am going to be making a log of what I've been learning to this site and will leave links to each entry below. I will also
    make available the programs I write whilst studying. These can be found at <a href = "https://github.com/MatthewSmithPhysics/Computational-Physics">
    Computational Physics Respository </a>.

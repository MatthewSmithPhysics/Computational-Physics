    <h3> Beginnings </h3>
    <p>
    I am currently a university student of maths and physics. On this programme, there are no assessments explicitly linked to
    computing beyond year 1. I have thus taken it upon myself to self-teach more advanced methods in computational physics and 
    maths. This log will document my progress and also serves as evidence of any experience gained. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Going into this, I have five years of experience with programming and have completed one year of university education in maths
    and physics. I have completed courses named Analysis I, Calculus and Probability I, Linear Algebra I, Foundations of Physics 1,
    and Discovery Skills in Physics (labs). I thus have a fair base of knowledge in both computing and maths/physics. As for the 
    interface of the two, I have a fair bit of experience with creating basic physics simulations, looking at topics such as 
    projectile motion and double pendulums. I am also currently working on a basic linear algebra library in C++, named 
    <i> smithlin </i>. I now want to tackle more advanced problems.
    </p>
    <p>
    As of writing this, I have not acquired any textbooks to help me but I intend to soon buy one. I have seen reccommendations for
    <i> Computational Physics </i> by Thijssen, so I think I should get that. From the looks of things, it spans a good range of 
    topics and so should be suitable. But for now, I can only wait.

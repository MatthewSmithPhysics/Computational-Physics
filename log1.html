    <h1> Matthew Smith's Computational Physics Log <h1>
    <h2> Entry 1- 18th August 2018 </h2>
    <h3> Preparation </h3>
    <p>
    It has been a good while since the last (and first) entry in this log. But today, I received my copy of Thijssen's Computational Physics through the mail. As I knew when purchasing, a lot of the content in this book that I am not familiar with, because it has not appeared in my course yet and will not appear for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
    For this reason, it is reasonable to expect significant gaps between the publication of these entries. I still intend to have an initial read of my new book, even if I don't fully comprehend the subject matter.
